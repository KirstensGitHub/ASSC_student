Poster Competition Info (Last Updated: 7/15/22):

At the time of registration, students can sign up for the poster competition. At the conference, judges view the submitted posters and record their judgements of the posters using the ASSC app. The student committee then determines the three winning posters based on judges' submissions. To win the competition, a presenter MUST be a graduate student and MUST be first author on the submitted poster. The awards are also associated with a cash prize.

Information for judges:

- You can share with the poster presenter that you are a judge, if desired, but it is not necessary.
- You SHOULD observe or verbally verify that the presenter is a student and that they are first author on the poster.
- If you find sections of the judgement questionnaire not applicable for a given poster, you may enter "N/A".
- You may wait until you have seen all posters to decide which poster is deserving of an award, as opposed to answering in real-time through the ASSC app (emailing us with your final recommendation)
